      <p>God! It's been so many years that I have known you...I know I know the starting wasn't really ideal, but in spite of all that 
        "Na ami khelbo na tor shathe", we've become best friends. I know it's mostly your credit but I am selfish... I don't care if 
        I don't deserve you or something, I want you as my friend, as the aunt of my kids, as my bridesmaid, as my one and only soulmate. 
        I want you to be the old granny next to me when we go on girl's trips at 60.

        <p>To be honest, the guilt of not being a good friend haunts me at times, but don't worry, I'm a CHANGED BACCHA...
          You always come first, bakira can fuck offf!!! Hahahahaa! But on a serious note, I genuinely wish we can grow old together just like how we have grown up together.</p>

        <p>Funny how it took me 12 months of lockdown and full isolation from human kind to find my real people. But hey, don't judge because now I ain't letting my gems go...
          Distance can't seperate us. DAMN!!! It brought us together... </p>

        <p>This isn't just for your birthday. It's just a little effort from my side to let you know I am always here for you.
          Things like the sun and water remind me of you, so don't think just becoz we ain't talking, just becoz we are busy in our lives, we are any further away from each others lives.
          You will always remain one of the biggest parts of my life. I am not Ajaitri without Adrija. There are lots of things that you have said that have literally pulled me back to life. So I hope you know
          day or night, sunny or stormy, happy or sad, no matter how my day has been, I am here ready to listen...gossips or rants...I'm here fore everything...

        <p>The only reason why I decided to do this, is to give you something a little more permanent...Something that won't be lost in the 
          hundreds of birthday wishes, buried deep in the pile of story mentions. I wanted to make something that you could come back to easily, whenever you wanted to.
          Something would make you feel my presence even when I am not around...</p>

        <p>20 years huh?! I am already imagining how it will be like 20 more years from now on, and then 20 years from then, and 20 more years
          , until our hair has turned grey, our skin has sagged, until we can't hear properly, until we take our last breadth... 
          Only one thing I am 100% sure of, is that, just like now, I'll love you with all my heart, my stans and pod...
